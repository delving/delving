# README for the Delving version of the Europeana Platform #


## Notice: No longer maintained

This version of the Delving CultureHub is no langer actively maintained. The core functionality is now being developed in the [Hub3](https://github.com/delving/hub3) repository.


**Europeana** is an European Commission initiative to bring together digital objects from the four cultural heritage domains: Archives, Audio-Visual, Archives, Libraries and Museums. The Europeana Framework is an innovative multilingual high volume, high scalability search platform for Cultural Heritage metadata. The framework is developed using best-of-breed open-source software.

In order to promote collaboration and reuse of the software in the Cultural Heritage sector the software is developed in the open under the name "Delving".

## Support from the Cultural Heritage Sector ##

The Delving Framework is currently being adopted by a wide variety of Cultural Heritage Institutions across Europe. The development and the current feature set would not have been possible without the support and contributions by the following organisations.

* [Europeana Foundation](http://www.europeana.eu) for donating the initial code-base to the open-source community
* [ABM-utvikling](http://www.abm-utvikling.no/), Norway for supporting the development of
	* The metadata/OAI-PMH repository
	* Sip-Creator templating and metadata upload functionality
* [Instituut Collectie Nederland](http://www.icn.nl/) ('Collectiewijzer' project), Netherlands for supporting the development of
	* The Sip-Creator collection managament and thematic grouping of metadata values support
	* The Portal Content-Management component with support of image upload, dynamic editing and creation of pages, and dynamic content on the homepage
* [Austrian Institute of Technology](http://www.ait.ac.at/), Austria for donating
	* The Annotation Component for Objects, Images, Movies and Maps (full integration planned in 2011)
* [Institut für Bibliotheks- und Informationswissenschaft](http://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/) (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin), Germany for supporting the development of
	* The ClickStreamLogging component and analyser with a special focus on multilingual user behaviour
	* Multilingual support of the full view page.


## Open-Source ##

You can find the source code at: [https://github.com/delving/delving/](https://github.com/delving/delving/)

Using [git] version control you can checkout the source code as follows:

	git clone git://github.com/delving/delving.git

or fork it on [github.com][delving]

The easiest way to contribute code to [delving] is to fork the repository and make a pull-request for your changes to be integrated into the main repository. Git makes it very easy to keep  branches and forked repositories in sync or to cherry-pick some changes.

The [github.com][github] repository is kept in sync with the [europeanalabs] subversion repository. This repository is used by the Europeana Core development team to maintain the operational service at [europeana.eu]. If you want you can also anonymously checkout this repository.

	svn checkout http://www.europeanalabs.eu/svn/europeana/trunk

However, other then the [github] repository it is not possible to directly contribute code to this repository.

## Delving versus EuropeanaLabs ##

Delving is the place where new functionality for [europeana.eu] is developed. When new functionality is deemed ready for production it can be integrated into the operational service code-base at [europeanalabs]. The Europeana Office decides the feature set of the EuropeanaLabs code-base.

The main differences between Delving and EuropeanaLabs are listed in the table below.
